One interesting relationship I found is that words tend to be very close to their respective plural word. For example, "group" has almost
the same embedding as "groups". The same happens with "island" and "islands".

Another relationship between words that is very noticeable is that words in the same semantic fields tend to be close to each other.
This is the case for "west", "north", "south" and "east"; "war" and "battle"; or "black" and "white".
